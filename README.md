### My personal compose journey tracking
This repository shows my journey to Jetpack Compose from my First Composable Function.

ðŸ‘‰ Introduction 
-----------
Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

- Less code
Do more with less code and avoid entire classes of bugs, so code is simple and easy to maintain.
- Intuitive
Just describe your UI, and Compose takes care of the rest. As app state changes, your UI automatically updates.
- Accelerate development
Compatible with all your existing code so you can adopt when and where you want. Iterate fast with live previews and full Android Studio support.
- Powerful
Create beautiful apps with direct access to the Android platform APIs and built-in support for Material Design, Dark theme, animations, and more.


ðŸ’» Requirements
